## Project Overview

This project aims to create a mini-game console comprised of joysticks, buttons, and a screen. A PCB will be designed to connect components and the entire kit will be placed within a 3d printed housing to secure the project components together.

## Educational Value Added

The project will help me learn about PCB creation and circuit wiring. Microcontroller writing and coding will also be a project component.
